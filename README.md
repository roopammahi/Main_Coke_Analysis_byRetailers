# Main_Coke_Analysis_byRetailers
📊Project Overview:-
This Project for coke sales analysis reveals a total annual volume of ~17.15 million units, driven primarily by strong performance in the West and Northeast regions. Sales show clear seasonal peaks in summer (June–August) and December, reflecting consumer demand cycles. Retailer contribution is highly concentrated, with Sodapop accounting for ~55% of total sales, followed by FizzySip (25%), BevCo (18%), and DreamCo (5%).

This project is described in excel format with excel tables and graph reports.

📊Project Conclusion:-
Overall, sales performance is robust and seasonally driven, but the business faces concentration risk due to heavy reliance on Sodapop. To sustain growth and reduce vulnerability, the COE should:
- Diversify retailer partnerships to balance sales distribution.
- Leverage peak demand months with targeted promotions and high-margin product pushes.
- Invest in growth regions (West & Northeast) for maximum ROI.
- Address seasonal dips (April, October) with tactical campaigns to stabilize performance.

📈 Strategic Takeaways
- Capitalize on seasonal peaks with aggressive promotions.
- Balance retailer portfolio to mitigate risk.
- Invest in growth regions for maximum ROI.
- Leverage insights to align supply chain and marketing with demand cycles.
